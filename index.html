              <h3>Can photography and coding complement each other?</h3>
              <p>
                Photography and coding may seem like distinct fields, but they
                complement each other in powerful ways, especially when it comes
                to telling visual stories. Both require creativity, attention to
                detail, and problem-solving, but what really connects them is
                their power to create narratives. With photography, I capture
                moments that convey emotion and meaning, while coding lets me
                build interactive experiences that bring those visuals to life.

              <h3>About me</h3>
              <p>
                As an amateur photographer, I love capturing the world around
                me, and I’m currently learning programming to blend creativity
                with tech. I’m a lifelong learner with a passion for nature,
                which led me to study biology, complete a master's in
                environmental and sustainability sciences, and earn a second
                degree in economics. I’m always excited to learn and take on new
                challenges.

              <h3>About this website</h3>
              <p>
                This website is created as a way to document my journey into
                coding while sharing my photography work. It’s a space where I
                combine my passion for visual storytelling with my exploration
                of programming. As I learn new coding skills, this site will
                evolve alongside my work, reflecting both my creative growth and
                technical development.
